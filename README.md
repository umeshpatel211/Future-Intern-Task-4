# Future-Intern-Task-4

# To develop a snake game:
Create a program where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. Initially,
the snake starts with a single segment and grows in length each time it eats food randomly 
placed on the screen. The player uses arrow keys to navigate the snake. The game ends if the 
snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen.
